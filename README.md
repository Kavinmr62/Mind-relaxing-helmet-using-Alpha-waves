Mind Relaxing Helmet with Alpha Waves A minor project developed under the Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, this Mind Relaxing Helmet combines head massaging with alpha wave music to promote mental and physical relaxation. The system uses an Arduino-based control unit to time the activation of massage and sound therapy cycles, providing a rhythmic and therapeutic relaxation experience.


**Project Members:** Archana J (927621BEE007), Bharath S (927621BEE014), Kavin M R (927621BEE062)


**Guided By:** Dr. K. Sundararaju


**Abstract:** Alpha waves (8–13 Hz) are brain waves linked to a relaxed, wakeful state. Specific alpha wave music can enhance these waves and promote relaxation. The helmet massages acupuncture points on the head, enhancing energy flow and circulation. The integration of massage and alpha wave stimulation elevates relaxation levels. Timed intervals of activity and rest are used to avoid overstimulation.
Problem Identified High stress levels due to work pressure. Lack of natural relaxation methods during headaches or anxiety. Poor sleep quality and blood circulation. Need for a portable, non-invasive mental relaxation solution.


**How It Works:** The helmet operates on a 10-minute cycle: 6 minutes ON (Massage + Alpha wave music) 4 minutes OFF (Rest mode) Controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Uses a relay to toggle power between devices based on timing logic.


**Components Used:** Arduino UNO – microcontroller for logic and timing 12V Adapter – for power supply Relay Module – switching mechanism MP3 Player Module – plays alpha wave music via SD card LM7805 – voltage regulator providing 5V output AC Supply (220V) – main power source
Medical Insight Alpha Waves: Induce calm, focused mental states. Head Massage: Improves circulation, relieves tension, and promotes energy flow.


**Cost Estimation Total Cost:** ₹3,200
